## General Info
My personal java project, a take on recreating a retro game by Microsoft.
This project utilizes object-oriented concepts in java to code the game logic for the MINESWEEPER Game. 
I have utilized some very basic GUI elements such as JButtons and JFrame to give a graphical interface to the Game.
